# SUPERMARKET-SALES-PREDICTION: Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling 

# CHAPTER 1

## ABSTRACT

The goal of this project is to forecast supermarket sales using a dataset that contains a variety of data points, including 'City', 'Customer type', 'Gender', 'Product line', 'Unit price', 'Quantity', 'Date', 'Payment', 'Total', 'gross income'. The project's goal is to determine the variables that have the greatest impact on supermarket sales and to develop a model that can properly predict sales growth. The project comprises feature selection, data exploration and visualization, and machine learning algorithms including logistic and linear regression. Stakeholders will receive effective interpretation and communication of the analyses' findings. The final objective is to offer insights that can boost sales.

## INTRODUCTION

The supermarket sales analysis is a study that involves the exploration and evaluation of sales data from a retail supermarket. In this analysis, we examine various factors that could affect the sales of a supermarket, including customer demographics, product line, payment methods, and others. We also aim to gain insights into the relationship between different variables in the dataset, such as the correlation between unit price, quantity, total sales, and gross income. Through statistical tests like t-test, ANOVA and chi-square, we aim to identify any significant differences in sales across different customer groups and product lines. Finally, we use machine learning techniques like feature selection, logistic and linear regression to predict future sales and optimize business strategies. The insights gained from this analysis could help supermarkets better understand their customers and make data-driven decisions to improve sales and customer satisfaction.
